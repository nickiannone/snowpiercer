# Onboard Arduino Project

This project is an Arduino application designed to demonstrate basic functionality.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── main.ino        # Main Arduino sketch
├── libraries           # Custom libraries
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open the project** in your Arduino IDE.

3. **Upload the sketch**:
   - Navigate to `src/main.ino`.
   - Select your board and port.
   - Click on the upload button.

## Usage

After uploading the sketch, the Arduino will execute the defined behavior in the `loop()` function. Modify the code in `main.ino` to customize the functionality as needed.

## Custom Libraries

Place any custom libraries in the `libraries` directory. Ensure they are properly included in your `main.ino` file.

## Git Ignore

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
